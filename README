A (slow) project attempting to use te Love2D engine with libpd as a sound resouce.

The to do list looks something like:
 - Finish luapd wrapper for libpd.
 - Make a nice lua file (lovepd.lua) for the Love2D engine to interface with libpd.
 - Make a tiny prototype to show off some features.
 - Figure how the hell I'm going to make it work on Windows.

I'll see how I get on.

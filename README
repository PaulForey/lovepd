A (slow) project attempting to use te Love2D engine with libpd as a sound resouce.

The to do list looks something like:
 - Finish luapd wrapper for libpd. --- This is pretty much done.
 - Make a nice lua file (lovepd.lua) for the Love2D engine to interface with libpd. --- Again, pretty much done.
 - I know have to make Love2D able to used lovepd.lua and the subsequent luapd_wrapper C code. This is tricky since Love2D's lua engine complains if you tell it to dynamically load a C library. It looks like I have to compile it into Love2D itself. I'm currently working on being able to compile Love2D on Mac OS X but I think I need to update my SDK, and therefore my XCode and my entire freakin' operating system. Sigh.
 - Make a tiny prototype to show off some features.
 - Figure how the hell I'm going to make it work on Windows.

I'll see how I get on.
